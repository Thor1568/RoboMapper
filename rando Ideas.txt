currently, messages are 1 second in length and contain content every other tick.
Max message length is 5, but this will be changed. 


Arduino needs to read dists from ult sensors and relay that to the PI. First messsage will contain which sensor is blocked,
then every message after until an empty message will sum to be the distance to that sensor in CM. 
PI can read the water sensor. Arduino can read the accelerometer to make sure its turns are accurate. Needs to recieve
movement instructions from the PI. First message will tell it to move in what direction(front, back, left, right), then
how long until an empty message


Relaying temperature will be the same process but temp can be disabled and rerun every hour or something.
Using power for temp and water is a waste. I need a way to toggle them.

Battery charging is still an issue lmao. All i got is a barrel jack solar panel and a normal one.

OK scratch the message thing, make the message save in an array and the array is a binary number. turn the binary number to
int and then I can send WAYYY more data xd
