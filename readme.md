# RoboMapper Project
## Senior capstone 2019-2020 yr

#### Goals:
* Create a robot
* Robot can record terrain
* Can measure its environment (ex: temperature, humidity, rain or not)
* Can avoid obstacles and remember where it has gone
* Can function on its own
* It can be remotely controlled
* **Challenge:** make robot charge itself through solar power

## What is this?
This is Github, a place where code can be worked on collaboratively and shared. This is a repository, or where my code for the project lives. I can use it to return to versions of code that function and demonstrate the project's progression over time from repository tracking.

## How is it organized?
First, the main code is located in the _Robomapper folder. But, there are 3 other folders. Docs is where I put information for other programmers who might use my project for whatever reason *(no one probably will)* so it is more likely the information is just for future reference for myself. Libs is where the project's libraries are. Any library that I create or use will be located here. Libraries are a collection of functions or objects that simplify code. Schematics is a folder where I make test projects. Schematics sometimes become libraries or are tests for libraries. I also have the project split into goals within the schematics/SubProjects folder.

## I don't understand
The wiki tab goes into more details. Enjoy!
